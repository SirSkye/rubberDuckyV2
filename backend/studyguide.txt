Organic Compounds
A molecular compound of carbon, not including CO(g), CO2(g), and  HCN(g).
Since carbon has 4 valence electrons, its atoms tend to form 4 covalent bonds.
Carbon atoms often bond with one another to form chains. 
These chain structures become the backbones of a range of molecules, some of them very complex.
Carbon-based molecules are the building blocks for life on Earth.

Alkanes 
A hydrocarbon is a compound that is composed only of carbon and hydrogen atoms. A saturated hydrocarbon, also known as an alkane, is a hydrocarbon in which all bonds between the carbon atoms are single bonds.
